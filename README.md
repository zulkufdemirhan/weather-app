# Weather-App

### The city name you enter in the application, you can learn the current weather conditions of that city and a picture specific to that city appears in the background.

#### I generally used Css and Javascript in the application.
#### CSS Properties: CSS Flexible Box Layout , CSS Transitions and Transforms , CSS Pseudo Elements and CSS Position Property
#### JavaScript Properties : Fetch Api , Click & Key events and Html Dom Events
